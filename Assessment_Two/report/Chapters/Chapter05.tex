There is only one field the user can enter text: the search field.

If the user enters no data, all locations are returned.

On all other cases and exact match is required to return a location.

If the user enters an already booked location a message window is displayed.

Due to this limited range of inputs the application should be able to cope with all incorrect inputs.
