\section{Plot-class}

The plot class provides the following attributes:

\begin{description}
\item[Id:] Unique identifier for a plot.
\item[Size:] The area in square-meters provided by the plot.
\item[Electricity:] Boolean depicting whether the plot provides electricity or not.
\end{description}

The cost is calculated by associating the size with the adequate cost - this is done in the \texttt{PriceMapping} class.

If the plot provides electricity another amount is added on top (can be changed in the plot class as constant - default value is 10).

\section{Status report}

The application should meet the specifications fully.
